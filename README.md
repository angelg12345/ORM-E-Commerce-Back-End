# ORM-E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description


This application is an e commerce site using express.js. In this application I built the back end which takes an express.js API and uses Sequelize to interact with a MYSQL database. I used Insomnia to check all the routes to see if they were working. 

## Usage

- To use this application you must clone the repository. 
- Then run an npm i to install the required packages. 
- After it is installed you must change the .env file to forefill your user and password.
- Create your database in my sql and drop your seed files into the database.
- Once these are done you must start the server using node server.js. 
- You now have access to the backend of this ecommerce site.
